# GoCardless Perl client library

This is a simple and incomplete client library for integrating with the
[GoCardless](http://www.gocardless.com) [API](https://developer.gocardless.com/)
written by [Mythic Beasts](http://www.mythic-beasts.com).

It's not completely disentangled from our own code base (see the docs for the
create_preauth method) but has code to handle the creation of signatures, and
demonstrates how to create the necessary authentication headers.
